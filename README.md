# HTML-JS Variable Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error where JavaScript variables are not correctly displayed within HTML. The bug involves trying to directly insert a JavaScript variable's value into the HTML without using proper DOM manipulation.

The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect implementation.  The `bugSolution.html` file provides a corrected version.

This example is useful for learning about the difference between inserting text directly into the HTML and dynamically updating the DOM using JavaScript.
